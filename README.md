# Data Extraction

In the [Scrape AWS MachineLearning Blogposts](./websites/aws/scrape_blogpost.ipynb) notebook we demonstrate how to extract content from blog posts using two methods.

- From the websites RSS Feed (top 20 blog posts)
- Using `BeautifulSoup` python library

>NOTE: If you need to access more than the 20 most recent blog posts, you would need to scrape the blog directly or use a different method that doesn't rely on the RSS feed. However, please be aware that web scraping should be **done in accordance with the website's terms of service** and with respect for the server's resources.
